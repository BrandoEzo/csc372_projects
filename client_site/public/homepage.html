          <h2>What is the URI Gaming Club?</h2>
          <p>We are an official URI Club focused on Video Games, Board Games, Card Games, and more! Our club provides a space
            for students to hang out during the day, frequented by both on campus students and commuters alike. We host multiple
            different types of events throughout the year, including weekly tournaments and game nights, <em>Dungeons & Dragons</em> games,
            and larger events where we partner with other URI Clubs, Student Involvement, The Ram's Den, and more! All are welcome
            casual gamers, to tabletop card game fanatics, to competitive esports tryhards!
          </p>

        <div class="card">
          <h2>Where are we located and what do we have?</h2>
          <p>We are located in room 312A of the URI Memorial Union, and host events out of the club room, room 360 across the hall,
            and occasionally the Ballroom, Atriums 1 and 2, and the Ram's Den, all located within the URI Memorial Union. We have several
            video game consoles, including two <em>Nintendo Switch</em> systems, a <em>Playstation 4</em>, an <em>Xbox 360</em>, several 
            modded <em>Wii</em> consoles full of og <em>Nintendo</em> games, a PC, plus lots of retro consoles that may or may not work fully. 
            Also, the club room has a full shelf of board, card and tabletop games, ranging from <em>Apples to Apples</em> and <em>Sorry</em> to 
            <em>Settlers of Catan</em>, <em>Risk</em>, and even more complicated games that nobody has ever heard of!

          <h2>Meetings and Events</h2>
          <p>Unlike most clubs, URI Gaming Club does not have traditional weekly or monthly meetings. We typically have one meeting
            at the beginning of the school year, focused on introducing the club to new members and laying the ground rules. Often
            we will start the semester with a casual game night where people can come and meet new friends and try out some of the wacky
            games we have, followed by the start of our weekly tournament series, <b>URI Rhody Rumble!</b> Our mainstay game is <em>Super
            Smash Bros. Ultimate</em>, where we are one of Rhode Island's premiere locals! We run a rotating cast of side games depending
            on where interest lies, including <em>Street Fighter 6</em>, <em>Rivals of Aether 2</em>, <em>Super Smash Bros Melee</em>, 
            <em>Guilty Gear: Strive</em>, <em>Tekken 8</em> and more! These tournaments are free to enter, and the winner of the main 
            <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em> bracket gets a $5 Dunkin Donuts Gift Card! We also host monthly paid brackets, <b>URI 
            Rhody Ruckus Monthly</b>, typically featuring singles and doubles for several games. This semester we will begin hosting 
            weekly game nights on Thursday for other games that people want to get together and play without the competitive nature 
            of the tournaments. Further events will be announced on this site and our Discord server.
